<h2>📊 Average Square Footage by County</h2>
<div id="vis1"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  vegaEmbed('#vis1', 'chart1.json');
</script>
<p>This bar chart compares the average square footage of buildings across different counties in Illinois. It gives a clear view of how building sizes vary by region. The x-axis shows each county using ordinal encoding, and the y-axis shows the average square footage as a quantitative measure. I sorted the counties by descending square footage to make the largest ones stand out.
No specific color map was used here since each bar represents the same metric. Tooltips are added to show exact values when hovering over the bars, which helps make the chart more informative without adding clutter.
The only data transformation done in the notebook was cleaning the column names to remove extra spaces. The aggregation of average square footage by county is handled directly within Altair using the mean function.</p>

<h2>📈 Interactive Trend by Usage</h2>
<div id="vis2"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  vegaEmbed('#vis2', 'chart2.json');
</script>
<p>This line chart shows how the average square footage of buildings has changed over time for the five most common usage types, like “Assembly” or “Office”. Construction years were grouped into 5-year bins to simplify the x-axis and make patterns easier to see. The y-axis shows the average square footage using a symlog scale so that smaller and larger values can be compared more clearly.
I used color to represent different usage types, so each line is visually distinct. A dropdown menu lets you highlight a single category, and there’s also a hover interaction to help focus on one line at a time.
In the notebook, I first filtered the dataset to remove rows with missing usage type or year values. I then converted the years to integers and grouped them into 5-year intervals. Finally, I filtered the data to include only the five most common usage types to keep the chart easy to read.</p>
