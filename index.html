<h2>Chart 2: Interactive Line Chart of Square Footage Over Time</h2>
<p>
This interactive line chart shows how average square footage has changed over time for the top 5 most common usage types (like “Assembly” or “Office”). 
Construction years are grouped into 5-year bins. Colors represent different usage types. 
A dropdown lets the user highlight one category at a time, and a hover effect adds focus on hover.
The chart uses symmetric logarithmic scale for better comparison of values.
